If you are reading this, you are interested in contributing a catalog for
inclusions in the LSST image simulation infrastructure.  This package is meant
to help with this process.

*** What this is ***
This package is meant to provide a relatively simple way to develop relatively
simple contributed catalogs.  Some of what is supported:
* custom SEDs
* custom variability models
* spectrum fitting to a library of standard spectra

*** What this is not ***
A mechanism to import arbitrarily large datasets into the imSims.  We expect
most of the contributed catalogs to be a few thousand objects at most.  We
also only currently support Galactic point source components.  We are working
on how to do extended and non-Milky Way sources.

*** Steps to composing a catalog. ***
1. Decide whether the positions you will provide are absolute or relative.  If
they are relative, we will do our best to tile them on the sky in some
reasonable way.
2. Decide on a spectrum for each source.
  a) The file, Star_SEDS.dat, in data/ gives a list of the stellar spectra
used in the current version of the image simulation database.  You may choose
any of these for your objects.
  b) Include your own spectra.  The (two) columns of the spectra must be space
delimited and must be wavelength in nanometers and flux density.
  c) Match an SED from the library of spectra to the six band LSST colors of
the object.
3. Decide whether the object should be embedded in a 3D model of dust
extinction.
4. If objects are variable, modify the code in python/variability.py to apply 
the variability model.
5. Generate the catalog.
6. Update settings.py
7. Make sure all lightcurves and spectra are in the right place.
8. Run the validator to check the catalogs.
